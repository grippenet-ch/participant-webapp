### Description of the Data 
The project has data from a participatory surveillance system that aims to monitor acute resiratory infections (ARI) and influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) in Switzerland, aiming to enhance our understanding of the transmission dynamics of respiratory infectious diseases and to provide insights into the symptoms they cause.

Together we can track the situation in Switzerland in an early stage.
Participants report every week whether they had one or several symptoms.

This graph shows the quantity of participants reporting a specific symptom. 
A combination of symptoms may indicate a specific infectious disease such as the flu, Covid-19, RSV, or others.
