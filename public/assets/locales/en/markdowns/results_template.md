# Description of the Data

The project has data from a participatory surveillance system that aims to monitor acute respiratory infections (ARI) and influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) in Switzerland, aiming to enhance our understanding of the transmission dynamics of respiratory infectious diseases and to provide insights into the symptoms they cause.

Together, we can track the situation in Switzerland at an early stage. Participants report every week whether they had one or several symptoms.


# Monitoring of symptoms and respiratory infections in Switzerland

The graph below shows the weekly incidence of ILI cases recorded on Grippenet.ch.
Each point represents the reported incidence for a given week, while the solid line shows the average over a two-week moving window.

**NOTE**:
The main symptoms of ILI can be caused by various viruses, such as seasonal influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or coronaviruses. Symptom-based monitoring via Grippenet.ch makes it possible to track ILI regardless of the underlying virus.

The graph above shows the number of participants reporting a specific symptom. A combination of symptoms may indicate a specific infectious disease, such as the flu, Covid-19, RSV, or others.
