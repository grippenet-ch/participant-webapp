### Summary of the project
Grippenet is led by scientists of the University of <mark><del>Geneva</del>Bern</mark>. The project was launched and implemented in Switzerland in 2016 in collaboration with the Institute of Global Health of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Geneva, the Laboratory of Computational Epidemiology (ISI, Turin), Computational Social Sciences (ETH, Zürich), the Laboratory of Digital Epidemiology (EPFL, Lausanne) and the National Reference Centre for Influenza (HUG, Geneva). It is a participatory information platform aiming to provide data-driven health services to patients, citizens and the general public, using a crowd-sourced data collection approach to protect the privacy of the participants, while offering educational benefits in return. It is part of a larger-scale project, Influenzanet, a European monitoring system first introduced in 2003 by the Netherlands and Belgium and subsequently implemented by nine other European countries, including Switzerland.

### Why are we conducting this study?
Influenza is a common disease that is present both in high-income as well as low- and middle-income countries. It is often regarded as a trivial, self-limiting disease. However, in its seasonal form, it is responsible for a significant excess mortality (1), morbidity and economic burden each year (2). In addition, scientists fear that the emergence of new viral strains, particularly such of animal origin (e.g. \"avian flu\"), could lead to a severe global epidemic (a \"pandemic\") that could rapidly cause millions or billions of deaths, as did the Spanish flu of 1918 (3). Influenza is therefore a serious challenge and the ability to monitor the disease and detect outbreaks early is very important.

Compared to traditional surveillance systems, which usually collect information about patients during their visits at their medical practioner, participatory systems allow voluntary citizens to report their symptoms directly, usually through the internet. These influenza surveillance systems, developed under the umbrella of the European Influenzanet network, have proven to be able to detect influenza outbreaks faster than traditional systems (4)-(7) and are easy to implement. The Grippenet project is adapting the existing Influenzanet platform to extend these benefits to Switzerland. We invite you to participate by registering yourself to our website. The data collected during the project makes a public contribution by allowing better monitoring of diseases. It also supports innovative research to improve our understanding of how influenza is transmitted and, more importantly, how epidemics can be effectively prevented and contained.

### What do we expect from the participants?

If you choose to participate (this is done by registering on the website) you will be asked to provide a pseudonym, an email address and a password. To maintain your anonymity we will not ask you for your name or address. An activation email will be sent to you to verify your email address. Once the verification stage is complete, you will be asked to complete a basic medical and demographic questionnaire (the intake questionnaire). In a second step you will be asked on a weekly basis to report the presence or absence of flu-like symptoms (the weekly questionnaire). Reminders will be sent to you via email or push notifications.

### What benefits can you expect as a result of participating in the study?

Through your participation, you will be directly informed about the current flu (Influenza) situation in Switzerland. However, the main benefit of your participation is for the public good. Your participation will specifically contribute to improve the monitoring of Influenza in Switzerland, which also helps to protect your health. In addition, you directly contribute to the research efforts in regards to Influenza and you are regularly informed about its progression. In general, this will allow you to receive better flu forecasts and recommendations to protect your health.

### What risks do you take if you decide to participate in this study?

We anticipate two types of limited risks when joining this study:

- The research team will have access to your questionnaire data, including basic demographic and medical information. However, your data, in raw form, is almost completely anonymous, as you are not asked to provide your first and last name, but only a pseudonym and an email address. Moreover, the pseudonyms and email addresses are stored separately from the questionnaire data. This means that we only analyse the anonymised questionnaire data without connecting them to your pseudonym and email address. In addition, we have designed our data collection strategy (detailed below in the data management section) in a way that the data collected via your smartphone is completely anonymised (\"privacy by design\"). That means, we never link this data to your pseudonym and email address unless you explicitly request us to do so.
- The risk of a cyber-attack leading to a leak of the data collected. This risk is however minimised by the infrastructure in place and our data privacy strategy (again, detailed in the data management section) which makes it difficult to link sensitive data to an individual's identity. In addition, the data we collect is very insensitive in nature and the same data could be diverted directly from your phone, regardless of your participation in this study.

### Participants' rights

The decision to participate must be solely based on your own free will. This decision will have no impact on your current or future medical care. At any point in time you can choose to stop participating. If you use the site and would like us to delete your data you can contact us using the details at the end of this document (which you can also find in the contact section of the website). Note however, the process of the deletion of your account - unlike in the case of a discontinuation of the study - requires us to link your health data to your pseudonym (information that is otherwise kept separate).

We also remind you that the law protects your right to access, update, rectify and object to the processing of your data. These rights include, but are not limited to: the right to obtain confirmation of the existence of data concerning you and to be informed of this in an comprehensible way, as well in regards to information on the source of the data, the purposes and methods of the processing, the updating, the correction or integration of your data, the erasure, the transformation into an anonymous form or blocking of personal data processed unlawfully, and the right to object, in whole or in part, to their use. Notwithstanding the above, except in cases where the law permits the processing of personal data without the consent of the data subject (for example, in order to comply with obligations established by law or to fulfill orders of public authorities, including judicial authorities), we will not use your personal data for any purpose other than the purposes of this study. Note that this may include the publication and presentation of the data in aggregated and fully anonymised form at scientific conferences.

### Data management

#### Privacy policy applicable to all users

As a participant, Grippenet will process your data in these surveys in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations and with full respect for your rights and, in particular, for your privacy.

**With your consent, and only after you have given it, we will process the following data:**

- Registration data: When you register we record and store the following personal data if you choose to provide it via the intake questionnaire: email address, home and work postal code, lifestyle data, family composition, health status and other basic demographic and medical data.
- Survey responses: periodically (usually weekly) we invite you to complete a questionnaire to obtain information on the presence or absence of flu-like symptoms.
- Communications: When you send us an email or contact us in any other way, we record and store these communications.

**Your personal data will be processed for the following purposes:**

- Undertake scientific research and statistical analysis on the spread of Influenza and COVID-19 and the preventive behaviour of people living in Switzerland. Machine learning methods will be used and we will study, among other things, the vaccination behaviour (e.g. getting the flu shot).
- Publish statistical analyses, graphical representations of results, but only with aggregated and anonymous data.
- Provide you with personalised information about the survey results (how many registered users in your area have the flu etc.).
- To protect the technical functioning of our computer systems by detecting fraudulent access attempts.

**The technical and organisational safeguards undertaken to protect your data**

Providing us with your data is always voluntary.

All identifying data (email address, IP address) are stored separately from the survey data. Data is shared in an anonymised form only with other members of the Grippenet consortium.

Data is deleted on request. If not, personal data will be deleted either when the service is terminated or in the event that future laws require it, whichever comes first. The data is stored on the Grippenet server, hosted in OVH's cloud storage, Gravelines 1, a high security data centre in France. This centre is specialised in the protection of physical servers as well as virtual access to servers. Only authorised personnel can access the physical location of the servers and access to the data is strictly controlled.

In addition, we (Influenzanet and Grippenet) provide a second security level. In this paragraph we provide the technical details of this security layer. All services are protected by a firewall that restricts access to individual machines. Access to public web services is only allowed via the HTTPS protocol. SSH access to remote servers requires a special key and is only allowed to system administrators and researchers who have been designated as responsible for the platform. All platforms have a stable operating system (currently Debian OS) and are updated according to the standard security policy. All services are continuously monitored. Failed access attempts are considered fraudulent and their Internet providers are blacklisted. The possibility of malicious access is continuously monitored.

**Data sharing policy**

The data is shared in an anonymised form with other members of the Grippenet consortium. The relationship between anonymous identifiers and email addresses (the only personal information we have) is not shared with other members of the consortium. Your data may be transmitted (but only in an anonymous or aggregated form) to other entities conducting scientific research or statistical analysis. The transmission of your data is always voluntary. It should be noted that the ISI Foundation (Turin), which coordinates the Grippenet project, manages the backend of the platform and the server database (1). Consequently, they have access to the researchers' server 1 data.
