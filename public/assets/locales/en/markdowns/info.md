**Definition of respiratory infections**

Respiratory infections affect the airways and can be caused by various viruses or bacteria. The most common **viral** pathogens include influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), as well as other common cold viruses. Bacterial pathogens (such as *pneumococci*, *pertussis*, or *Haemophilus influenzae*) can also cause respiratory tract infections.

Symptoms of viral respiratory infections can be similar and include, for example, cough, runny nose, fatigue, other respiratory symptoms, and fever. These symptoms are often non-specific and may be mild (e.g. a common cold) or severe (e.g. pneumonia).

At [Grippenet.ch](www.grippenet.ch), we are particularly interested in monitoring **acute respiratory infections** (**ARIs**) and **influenza-like illnesses** (Influenza-like Illness, **ILI**) in Switzerland. We define ARIs as the sudden onset of at least one symptom of the upper or lower respiratory tract. ILI is defined by the [*WHO*](https://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme/surveillance-and-monitoring/case-definitions-for-ili-and-sari) as follows:
- fever ≥ 38 °C
- and cough
- with symptom onset within the last 10 days

**Treatment**

For most viral respiratory infections, **symptomatic treatment** is the main approach, such as adequate rest, sufficient fluid intake, and fever-reducing or symptom-relieving medication. Antiviral therapies are available for some viral infections, but they are usually used only for specific **risk groups**, for example people with pre-existing conditions or in cases of severe disease. Severe courses and complications occur more frequently in older adults, people with chronic diseases, immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women, and infants and young children.

Viruses such as influenza, SARS-CoV-2, or RSV are not treated with antibiotics. **Antibiotics** should only be used for **bacterial infections**, not preventively, and exclusively on **medical prescription** (more information at [star.admin.ch](www.star.admin.ch/en)).  
As the immune system is weakened during a viral infection, bacterial secondary infections may occur more easily. In the case of persistent or severe symptoms, it is advisable to consult a doctor.

**Preventive measures**

- *Pharmaceutical measures*: **Vaccinations** can protect against severe disease caused by [seasonal influenza](https://www.impfen-schweiz.ch/de/saisonale-grippe-influenza), [RSV](https://www.impfen-schweiz.ch/de/rsv-erwachsene), and [Covid-19](https://www.impfen-schweiz.ch/de/covid-19) (more information at [www.bag.admin.ch](https://www.bag.admin.ch/en/vaccinations-and-prevention), [Infovac](https://www.infovac.ch/de/), or [impfen-schweiz.ch](https://www.impfen-schweiz.ch/de)). Your doctor or pharmacist can also provide individual advice.

- *Non-pharmaceutical measures*: Infections can be prevented by staying at home when experiencing symptoms, reducing contacts, wearing (FFP2) masks, and following hygiene measures such as hand washing.

**Data collection**

In Switzerland, several systems are used to observe respiratory infections in the population:
- [Sentinella-System](https://www.sentinella.ch/de/info)
- [Wastewater Surveillance](https://wise.ethz.ch/?page=overview)
- [Swiss Pathogen Surveillance Platform (SPSP)](https://spsp.ch/)
- [Swiss Paediatric Surveillance Unit (SPSU)](https://www.spsu.ch/en/home)

**[Grippenet.ch](www.grippenet.ch)** complements these systems. Through participatory surveys, researchers at the [University of Bern](https://www.ispm.unibe.ch/) collect symptom data directly from the population, including from people who do not consult a doctor. This allows the detection of infection waves and associated respiratory symptoms in Switzerland.

All people residing in Switzerland can **participate** online, regardless of age, vaccination status, or health condition. Ideally, participants report their symptoms weekly (but occasional reports are also valuable).
