**What is Grippenet?**  
Grippenet.ch is a participatory population survey that monitors acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) in Switzerland. By participating, individuals help with the early detection of infection waves and contribute to a better understanding of symptoms associated with respiratory infections. The project was developed in 2016 in collaboration with the Institute of Global Health (ISG, University of Geneva), the Laboratory of Computational Epidemiology (ISI, Turin), Computational Social Sciences (ETH Zürich), the Laboratory of Digital Epidemiology (EPFL, Lausanne), and the National Reference Center for Influenza (HUG, Geneva). Since 2025, the project has been led by researchers at the [Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine](https://www.ispm.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) (ISPM, University of Bern).

Weekly reports from participants help monitor respiratory infections and provide early insights into their spread and associated symptoms.

**How does Grippenet work?**  
The principle is simple: you register confidentially and quickly on [Grippenet.ch](www.grippenet.ch). Upon registration, you complete a short questionnaire once, providing information about your age, occupation, and any pre-existing conditions, allowing us to collect basic background information.  

Afterwards, you receive a weekly reminder by email asking whether you have influenza-like symptoms or not. If so, you answer a few additional questions about the symptoms you are experiencing. The process takes only 30 seconds to a maximum of 5 minutes. Ideally, participants respond briefly each week.  

Through your participation, we can collect symptom data without involving doctors or hospitals. This allows timely observation of mild cases, for which patients usually do not seek medical care. The collected data complement other systems (more at [Grippenet.ch/info](www.grippenet.ch/info)).  

In a second phase, data collected in Switzerland and other European countries will be analysed to better understand virus transmission, symptoms, and implemented measures. Grippenet.ch is part of [Influenzanet](https://influenzanet.info/), a European network founded in 2003 that connects researchers conducting similar surveys and analyses in different countries.

By participating, you make an important contribution to public health and research.
