### 08/11/2022 – It's time to get your flu vaccine!

Vaccination against influenza is an effective, simple and economical way to protect yourself and your loved ones against influenza. Today we offer you a summary of the key points concerning flu vaccination, taken from the FOPH's information bulletin (1):

-	**Recommended period**: From mid-October until the start of the flu season (usually around January).
-	**Available vaccines**: 4 vaccines available in Switzerland for the 2022/2023 season.
-	**Who is concerned**: The recommendations for vaccination in 2022 are identical to those of previous years. They are aimed in particular at adults/children with a high risk of complications in the event of influenza, as well as at people who are regularly in close contact (in the private or professional sphere) with vulnerable people, namely those over 65 years of age, patients with comorbidities, pregnant women and health system personnel. More details at: www.sevaccinercontrelagrippe.ch (2).
-	**Where to get vaccinated**: From your family doctor, paediatrician or gynaecologist, in your retirement home, in a pharmacy, in hospital (and in some cases, by nursing staff from home help and care services).
-	**Reimbursement**: For people with a high risk of complications from influenza, the vaccination is covered by the health insurance (subject to the deductible amount).
-	**Other hygiene rules**: In addition to vaccination, simple hygiene rules can reduce the risk of influenza transmission (e.g. regular ventilation of enclosed spaces, staying at home if influenza/COVID-19 is suspected, keeping your distance, wearing a mask, good hand hygiene).

### 01/09/2022 - Back to school, what are the possible scenarios with SARS-CoV-2?

Although the Swiss health surveillance system underestimates the cases of COVID-19, the peak of the BA.5 wave has now been reached in our country. So what are the possible or likely scenarios for the new school year? Professor Antoine Flahault, Director of the Institute of Global Health in Geneva, proposes four scenarios, which we summarize here (1):
-	**The 1st scenario (optimistic)**: the lull continues for a few more weeks, without any new variant other than the BA.5 currently in circulation.
-	**The 2nd scenario (less optimistic)**: a second wave due to the BA.5 variant occurs, partly due to recontamination, as the current variant leaves little trace in our immune system.
-	**The 3rd scenario (less optimistic)**: a new variant appears, of unknown contagiousness and virulence, and spreads rapidly, creating a new wave.
-	**The 4th scenario (pessimistic)**: this last scenario consists of the co-circulation of several variants at the same time; these variants being more or less contagious and virulent than the previous ones.

In conclusion, "Whatever the scenario that emerges in the autumn, (...) it is crucial to show anticipation, humanity and solidarity" (1). Moreover, in order to improve our anticipation capacities, a quality health surveillance system is important, which is the reason for the existence of the Grippenet platform. So thank you for your valuable collaboration!

### 22/06/2022 - Increasing numbers of new COVID-19 infections in Switzerland - what you can do to protect yourself and your loved ones

The Federal Office for Public Health recommends five main protective measures to avoid a possible infection with COVID-19 in light of the recent increase in new-infections (1):  
1.	**Get vaccinated**: The vaccine provides the maximum of a possible protection against an infection with COVID-19. It also diminishes the chances of infecting another person as well as the chances of developing Long-COVID.    
2.	**Wear a mask**: COVID-19 is an airborne virus (this means it can be transmitted through aerosols which are set free through breathing, speaking, sneezing or coughing). The wearing of a mask prevents those aerosols from being set free into the air and can therefore interrupt the infection-route.  
3.	**Ventilate your home multiple times a day**: Because COVID-19 is transmitted through the air, the ventilation of indoor-spaces is especially important. If not too cold, keep your windows open to improve air-circulation in indoor-spaces.
4.	**Wash or disinfect your hands**: It is crucial to wash or disinfect (using hand-sanitizer) your hands on a regular basis. This is especially important after touching surfaces which are also touched by other people on a regular basis, after sneezing or coughing or before cooking.
5.	**Cough and sneeze into your handkerchief or elbow**: When sneezing or coughing use a handkerchief or cover your nose and mouth with your elbow. Use a paper-handkerchief and throw it away after you used it. Also wash or disinfect your hands after sneezing/coughing.

### 08/06/2022 - We really value your participation - thank you!

The Grippenet-Team welcomes you once again to our new platform and we want to thank you for your loyalty to Grippenet! The participatory surveillance platform allows the surveillance of influenza and COVID-19 cases thanks to citizens reporting their flu-like symptoms on a voluntary basis. This allows an earlier detection of possible cases and also the follow-up of mild cases. Therefore, your participation is indispensable, whether or not you are experiencing flu-like symptoms.

If you want to have an overview of the results of previous years, we propose you to read an article written by the Grippenet team and published in 2020: *Richard et al., A New Tool for the Monitoring, Risk-Factor and Vaccination Coverage Analysis of Influenza-Like Illness in Switzerland. Vaccines [Internet]. 2020 Jun 27. Available from: https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/8/3/343.*
