This folder contains images for the avatars defined inside `appConfig.json`.

Avatar images should be `png` images.

The image name should start with the corresponding `avatarId` with the first letter capitalized.

Two `png` versions should be created:

1. `[Avatarname]_Schwarz.png` - black and white version
2. `[Avatarname]_Bunt.png` - color version
