**Description of the data**

The project has data from a participatory surveillance system that aims to monitor acute respiratory infections (ARI) and influenza-like illnesses (ILI) in Switzerland, aiming to enhance our understanding of the transmission dynamics of respiratory infectious diseases and to provide insights into the symptoms they cause.

Together, we can track the situation in Switzerland at an early stage. Participants can report every week whether they had one or several symptoms.


**Monitoring of symptoms and respiratory infections in Switzerland**

The graph below shows the estimated weekly incidence of ILI and ARI cases recorded on Grippenet.ch.
The line shows an average over a moving window.

**Note**:
The symptoms of ARI and ILI can be caused by various viruses, such as seasonal influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or coronaviruses. Symptom-based monitoring via Grippenet.ch makes it possible to track ARI and ILI regardless of the underlying virus.

The graph above shows the frequency of participants reporting a specific symptom (as darker as more participants reported the symptom). A combination of symptoms may indicate a specific infectious disease, such as the flu, Covid-19, RSV, or others.
