Dear Grippenet participant,

On **January 6th 2025**, the ownership of the Grippenet platform and related data will be transferred
from the University of Geneva (UNIGE) to the University of Bern (UniBE) . Grippenet will continue to
be part of **Influenzanet** â€“ a Europe-wide initiative for studying the transmission of influenza and
COVID-19.

## What does this mean for you?

Your data will only be transferred to UniBE with **your consent** and then your participation on the
platform will continue as usual. The purpose and scope of data usage by UniBE researchers will
remain unchanged, in line with the privacy policy you accepted when you registered. Your data will
continue to be treated confidentially, not shared with third parties, and used only for analyses to
improve public health.

**Important**:

- Without your consent, your data and account will be automatically and permanently deleted on
January 6, 2025.

- You may re-register at any time, but your profile cannot be restored.

## What do you need to do?

**Please log in to your Grippenet** account before January 6, 2025, to give your consent to the data
transfer. You will find the updated privacy policy in your profile and will be asked for your consent.
Thank you for your participation and engagement. Your contribution is crucial to understand the
epidemiology of influenza and COVID-19 in Switzerland.

Kind regards,

The Grippenet Team
